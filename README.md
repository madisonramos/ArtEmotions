ArtEmotions aims to predict emotional responses to artworks by analyzing features such as art period, artist, creation year, medium, and subject focus. Building upon the WikiArt Emotions dataset, which comprises 4,105 artworks annotated for emotions evoked in observers, this project refines the data and develops a predictive model to classify viewer reactions as positive, negative, or mixed.
